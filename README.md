# About me 
Hello, I'm Laura Payan Cepeda, and I’m a data and business analyst. My journey started in business, where I quickly fell in love with strategy. Over time, I realised that data is what truly drives well-informed decisions. Now, I help businesses and their teams solve challenges and reach their goals by making data work for them. Data holds the key to performance, but only when it’s understood and used the right way. I’m driven by curiosity, ambition and a passion for using data to create real, meaningful results.

## Analytics and Business Intelligence
### Business Intelligence to support real-life decision-making and core functions in an SME (Power BI)
As part of my master’s dissertation, I developed a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard using Power BI with data from Odoo ERP. The project involved designing and developing seven functional navigation tabs covering key business areas, including sales, inventory, purchasing, and customer relationship management (CRM). 

The company's primary requirements for this dashboard were to streamline data management, enhance operational efficiency, and improve decision-making through data-driven insights. Additionally, I identified and resolved data management errors, improving overall data accuracy. The dashboard provided real-time analytics, enabling better supplier performance tracking, stock monitoring, sales conversion analysis, customer engagement, and order fulfillment tracking, ultimately driving business growth and competitiveness.

### Football Match Game Performance Analysis (Tableau)
This Tableau dashboard analyzes Liverpool's performance in the 2019 Champions League Final (Statsbomb data), focusing on key metrics such as pass maps, shot locations, passing success rates, and player positioning. It provides insights into the team’s passing efficiency, attacking strategies, and overall performance, offering a comprehensive view of the match. I am currently still working on this dashboard, hoping to bring more metrics and KPIs.

### UEFA EURO 2024 Player and Team Performance Analysis (R and Power BI)
This project, which I learned about through a webinar, leverages Statsbomb data to analyze player and team performance during the UEFA EURO 2024 season using RStudio. It ranks teams based on shooting volume, measuring the number of shots taken, and highlights the attacking contributions of the top 20 players (with a minimum of 360 minutes played) by analyzing shots and key passes per 90 minutes. The visualization also showcases player progressions, such as completed passes into the final third, with a specific focus on Toni Kroos’s role in ball distribution.

Initially, I visualized the data in R, as demonstrated in the webinar, but I decided to further develop the analysis in Power BI for more interactive insights, which is currently in progress (coming soon).

#### Session Training and Player Performance (Power BI) 
My goal with this dashboard is to use 1 month of GPS and Wellness Data, and review Real Madrid's outcomes of specific training sessions, track how an athlete’s wellness scores align with their usual averages, and evaluate their recent performance in relation to their historical bests over time.

#### Player Wellness, Workload and Weekly Outlook Dashboard and Report (Google Sheets)
This time, I created a dashboard in Google Sheets to monitor individual players' wellness, workload, and weekly training outlook. The dashboard allows filtering by player and date, displaying key stats.

## Predictive Analytics 

### Predicting Customer Acceptance for Car Purchases Using a Decision Tree Model
Developed a decision tree model to predict customer acceptance of car purchases based on key factors such as price, maintenance cost, safety ratings, and seating capacity. The model achieved an accuracy of 95% with a 10% classification error, demonstrating strong predictive performance in identifying buying preferences.

### Business Intelligence for Fisheries Conservation and Forecasting (Tableau and RapidMiner)
Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualise Lake Powell fisheries data (2004–2018), uncovering trends in environmental patterns, fish populations, and ecosystem health. Built a Random Forest predictive model in RapidMiner to forecast fish weight based on stomach contents, achieving 56.91% accuracy, with 94.77% precision for lighter fish and 99.19% recall for heavier fish.This research aims to develop a data-driven model that supports fisheries management, ecological research, and conservation efforts, facilitating the monitoring and preservation of aquatic ecosystems.

### Sentiment Analysis and Pattern Recognition in Personal Journals for Emotional Well-being (R)
I developed a sentiment analysis and clustering model to analyse personal journal entries, uncovering emotional patterns and themes that influence well-being. By examining past journal data, the model is able to predict emotional trends, identify triggers, and offer personalised well-being recommendations. Using K-means clustering, the entries were categorised into three distinct sentiment groups: Slightly Positive, mostly linked to family-related emotions; Negative, largely associated with work-related stress; and Very Positive, characterised by themes of family and enjoyment. To further enhance the analysis, I applied the Apriori algorithm to identify associations between words and recurring themes within each sentiment group, providing valuable insights into emotional triggers and behavioural patterns.
